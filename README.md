# Reporter

Reporter is a **minimalist plain text editor**. At the begining, it was based on [Left](http://github.com/hundredrabbits/Left) for educationnal purpose. I try to personalize it with my vision ðŸ˜„. You can see some plan below

Some other inspirations : [Bear](https://bear.app/), [Transno](https://transno.com/), [Typora](https://typora.io/), [Byword](https://bywordapp.com/), [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/), [Abricotine](https://github.com/brrd/Abricotine), [Caret](https://caret.io/)
